	<p>From the escapism of F Scott Fitzgerald to the story of the woman who edited Vogue in the Blitz, the Guardian fashion team suggest style-focused books to distract and inspire </p>
	<h2>The Mirror and the Light by Hilary Mantel</h2>
	<p>“It is the present we must reckon with,” observes Thomas Cromwell in the final part of Mantel’s trilogy. You can say that again, mate. At 900 pages, The Mirror and the Light has arrived eerily perfectly formed for the present we are reckoning with – and I don’t just mean that the hardback version is the perfect size for putting under your laptop to avoid double chin on Zoom calls. Cromwell is a master of optics and power dressing five centuries ahead of his time: he sees the visual messaging in every embroidered cloak and the symbolism in every jewellery love gift. Also, the square necklines are very this-season Rixo.

<h2>Tender is the Night by F Scott Fitzgerald</h2>
<p>Even if you have yet to surrender to a full day in sweatpants, life probably feels less than glamorous at the moment. What better world to get lost in, then, than one described by F Scott Fitzgerald. The Great Gatsby is the obvious choice, but if you pine after a cancelled holiday to, say, the south of France, the author’s last novel is a good way to get your Riviera fashion fix. From bathing suits and corsages to the notion of dressing for dinner, there is plenty of style inspiration to stockpile.

<h2>The Thoughtful Dresser by Linda Grant</h2>
<p>If you have ever felt sheepish about having an interest in style, I urge you to read this book. It argues that clothes are far from a trivial or superficial pursuit, through potted fashion history and reflection from luminaries such as Jane Austen and Nancy Mitford. Most memorable, though, are the stories of women in horrific circumstances who have used clothing as balm; the image of a seamstress customising her fellow prisoners’ uniforms in Ravensbrück concentration camp during the second world war has stayed with me since I read it a decade ago. The book is a great read for where we’re at now – joyful, hopeful and free of judgment. It seems to say: whatever makes you feel better, whatever you enjoy when life is otherwise bewildering, you should absolutely go for it.
